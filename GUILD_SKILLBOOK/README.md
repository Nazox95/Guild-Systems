-With this system you can create a new item to decrease value for skill guilds. Only leader can use this book. -For the moment the only problem is you can't see the name in inventory only say (Skill Forget book), but in the ground you can see the name. I'm working on that.

-Remember, you need have the same in ItemCSV (dump_proto) and ProtoReader (DB source)

-Don't forget add in item_names.txt a new id for this example is '50341' , for item_proto.txt only copy the other book '70037' and change id, like this:

50341 ¸Á°¢ÀÇ ¼­ ITEM_SKILLFORGETGUILD 0 1 NONE NONE NONE NONE 0 0 0 0 0 LIMIT_NONE 0 LIMIT_NONE 0 APPLY_NONE 0 APPLY_NONE 0 APPLY_NONE 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
